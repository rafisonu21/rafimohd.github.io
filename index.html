        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate with a strong foundation in data analysis, poised to leverage my expertise in data visualization and analytics in the professional world. My journey in this field was significantly enriched through my experience at Accenture, a leading consulting firm, where I developed a practical understanding of data challenges and solutions in a real-world context. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.</p>
        <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a passionate involvement in cricket, both as a player and a viewer, which inspires me to integrate my interests with my academic skills. This led me to undertake a project analyzing various cricket teams to determine the world’s best, utilizing advanced data visualization techniques. The project was a perfect blend of my love for the sport and my skills in data analysis, allowing me to explore innovative ways to interpret sports statistics and share those insights through compelling visual stories. Additionally, my fascination with the ancient history of India enriches my perspective, allowing me to draw unique parallels between past and present in both my personal and professional explorations.</p>
